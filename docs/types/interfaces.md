### Interfaces

In the type system, interface objects are treated as the same as class objects.
Interfaces are simply descriptions of functionality that a conforming class
must contain. Like classes, interfaces must always be reference counted. Unlike
structures and classes, you can not access members, only methods.

Interfaces will be discussed in greater detail in a later chapter.
